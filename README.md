## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Overview**  
   Loaded the Titanic dataset and inspected data types, missing values, and basic statistics.

2. **Univariate Analysis**  
   Explored distributions of individual features such as Age, Sex, and Survival status.

3. **Bivariate Analysis**  
   Examined relationships between two variables, e.g., survival rate by gender and passenger class.

4. **Multivariate Analysis**  
   Investigated correlations and multiple feature relationships using heatmaps and pairplots.

5. **Summary & Insights**  
   Compiled observations and key takeaways from the analysis.

## 📊 Summary of EDA Findings

- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males.  
- Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive than those in 2nd or 3rd class.  
- Younger passengers had slightly better survival odds.  
- Fare shows a weak positive correlation with survival; higher fares often relate to 1st class.  
- Many missing values were observed in the 'Cabin' column, which may affect model accuracy if used.  
- No strong multicollinearity was observed among major features.
